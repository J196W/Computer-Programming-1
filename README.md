# Computer-Programming-1
This is my code for CP1. **DO NOT COPY THIS CODE. THAT WOULD BE PLAGORISM. JUST LOOK AT IT AND ALL OF ITS GLORY**

All of this was coded in Virtual Studio. Download it [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/post-download-vs?sku=community&clcid=0x409&downloadrename=true#) 
## But why
Many people ask me later on, "How did you do this". Now, I can just send them a link to this. I will only upload projects once they are complete.
## Disclaimer
I can not garentee that:
- The code works
- All of the files will be uploaded
- No one will try and look at your answers

#### However
As of the time these files are uploaded, all of them *should* be complete.

## **THE CODE I DOWNLOADED HAD AN ERROR**
Please just make an new issue, I will handle it as soon as possible

## **WHERE IS THE FILE I AM LOOKING FOR**
Just create an issue, I will see if I have the file, I will upload it immediately

Good luck
